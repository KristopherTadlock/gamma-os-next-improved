# gamma-os-next-improved

A modified build of [GammaOS Next](https://github.com/TheGammaSqueeze/GammaOSNext)
v1.2 (Full edition) for the **Anbernic RG Cube**.

This repository doesn't contain firmware images. It holds the scripts and
file overlays that turn the official GammaOS Next release into the modified
build, so you can rebuild it yourself.

## Base

- Upstream release: [`v.1.2.0-ANBERNICRGCUBE`](https://github.com/TheGammaSqueeze/GammaOSNext/releases/tag/v.1.2.0-ANBERNICRGCUBE)
- Edition: Full (Android 14 / LineageOS 21, with Google Play)

## Changes from upstream

Emulators updated to their latest releases (installed on first boot):

| Emulator | Upstream v1.2 | This build |
|---|---|---|
| RetroArch | 1.22.1 | 1.22.2 |
| RetroArch cores | 152 cores, mixed 2023-2025 builds | one core per system (see `mods/retroarch-cores.txt`), latest buildbot nightlies at build time |
| Flycast | 2.5 | 2.7 |
| PPSSPP | 1.19.2 | 1.20.4 |

The RetroArch cores are cut down to a curated set (see
`mods/retroarch-cores.txt`), which shrinks `retroarch.tar.xz` from 336 MB to
271 MB. Game Boy and Game Boy Advance link-cable play over RetroArch netplay
(local network or internet) is available through the DoubleCherryGB and gpSP
cores. Edit `mods/retroarch-cores.txt` to change the selection.

Daijisho's default player for each platform follows the cores marked `D - `
in that file:

| Platform | Upstream v1.2 | This build |
|---|---|---|
| Game Boy, Game Boy Color | Gambatte | SameBoy |
| Game Boy Advance | gpSP | mGBA |
| NES | Nestopia | Mesen |

RetroArch's core info files and the PPSSPP core's assets are refreshed to
match the new cores. Mupen64Plus FZ (3.0.335) and DraStic (r2.6.0.4a) are
already the latest public releases.

### Pack-in games

The bundled ROM pack is replaced with one game per platform, each with an
explicit grant to redistribute it and no third-party characters or names.
Each game is installed with its license text. See
[PACK-IN-GAMES.txt](PACK-IN-GAMES.txt) for the games, their licenses, and the
upstream games that were removed and why; `mods/bundled-roms.txt` is the list
the build uses.

## Building

On Linux with `curl`, 7-Zip (`7zz` or `7z`), `xz`, `unzip`, `e2fsck`, `cc`,
`python3`, `sudo` (to loop-mount the system image), and about 40 GB free:

```sh
scripts/build.sh
```

This downloads the official release, applies each script in `mods/` to its
system partition, and writes `out/RG_Cube_GammaOS_Next_Improved_v1.2.pac`.

The tools it uses:

- `scripts/pactool.py` lists, extracts, and replaces images in the Unisoc
  `.pac` firmware package, and recomputes its CRC.
- `scripts/lptool.py` lists, extracts, and replaces logical partitions
  (`system_a`, `vendor_a`, ...) in the raw `super_full.img`.
- `tools/crc16arc.c` is the CRC-16/ARC helper `pactool.py fixcrc` uses.

The upstream system filesystem is built with deduplicated blocks, which
can't be mounted read-write. The build grows it to fill its partition and
unshares the blocks, which leaves about 77 MB free for changes.

## Flashing

Flash the result the same way as stock GammaOS Next. Follow the upstream
